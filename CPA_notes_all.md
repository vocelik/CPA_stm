# Corporate Political Activity

## Background

__All articles share the common elements__:

- They discuss the _relationship_ between business and government.
- The free-rider problem has been central to CPA research since Olson (1965).
- First generation management researchers on CPA include:
  - Gerald D. Keim.
  - Carl P. Zeithaml.
  - Barry D. Baysinger.
- First clear multinational-oriented paper was Gladwin & Walter (1980).
  - But their article is really more about conflict and how MNEs can deal with conflicts effectively. MNEs are invoked mostly because, compared to their domestic counterparts, MNEs operate in environments that are uncertain, conflicting, ambiguous, and subject to rapid change. 
- Exchange view of politics.
  - The interdependence of _suppliers_ of public policy and _demanders_ of public policy. 
- A central question in the body of research on CPA explores its connection to performance.
  - The current consensus on the matter resembles the discussion about the relationship between CSR and firm performance (Margolis & Walsh, 2003).
- A common thread throughout the literature is that firms can either adapt to or resist government pressures.
  - buffering versus bridging.
  - bargaining versus non-bargaining.
- A lot of articles make the point that either a) we need to see firms as political creatures, b) we need to integrate political activity in the domain of international strategy management, c) that strategy formulation requires integreating both market and nonmarket components, d) that government should be considered a factor of production, e) CEOs consider governmental affairs as a vital part of the job.
  - All of this basically underlies the claim that any seperation between economics and politics is inaccurate, fallible, and could lead to erroneous policy.

__Accepted Definitions__:

- _Corporate_ attempts to shape _government policy_ in ways favorable to the firm (Hillman, Keim, & Schuler, 2004, emphasis my own).
  - Why only corporations? The word _corporate_ pertains to large companies or groups. Firms exist in many forms, and a theory of their political activity should aspire to formulate general principles that apply to all firms, not only the large ones. _Business_ political activity, therefore, seems like a more apt nomenclature. 
  - What falls under the rubric of _government_: national, regional, local, municipal? Freeman (1984) offers a helpful guide. It is, however, based on US politics, and therefore the generalizability of his model is unclear. 
    - Bureaucracy.
    - Foreign governments.
    - Citizen initiatives.
    - Local governments.
    - Congress.
    - Sate governments.
    - Courts.
  - How can governments affect businesses? Stilger (1971) is most clear on this issue. 
    - Subsidies.
    - Price fixing.
    - Enactment of entry barriers.
    - Affecting substitutes and complements.
  - How can corporations know how a policy will affect their corporation? Is the process of policy-making not inherently opaque, making any preconceived position on a policy issue necessarily dubious? 
  - What do we mean by favorable and favorable to whom? Shareholders, employees, suppliers, customers?
- In their article, Hillman et al. cite Baysinger (1984) as the source of this definition. However, Baysinger actually never explicitly defined _corporate political activities_. He also seemed to use the terms _corporate political activity_ and _business political activity_ interchangeably, which is hard to justify because business is a general term, while corporate refers to large companies. Baysinger did include an implicit definition of such activities:
  - \[Corporate] attempts to elicit the direct political support of their employees, shareholders, customers, suppliers, and so forth for the candidates and/or public policies they favor (Baysinger, 1984, p. 248).
  - This definition comes tantilizingly close to stakeholder management.
  - This definition is built on the work of Keim (1981).
- Keim (1981) also actually never defines Corporate Political Activity.
- He does state that: _business must be increasingly proactive in the political arena_ (Keim, 1981, p. 41).
- And: _Successful managers must understand the public policy process, anticipate the potential consequences of emerging issues, and implement effective corporate political strategies_ (_Ibid._).
-  He then goes on to discuss the implications of recent political development on Corporate Political Strategy:
   -  Building a corporate constituency.
   -  Building political coalitions.
   -  Executive Public Affairs Responsibilities and Education.
   -  Employee political involvement and lobbying.
   -  Corporate Political Action Committees (CPACs).
- Lawton, McGuire, & Rajwani (2013) cite Hillman & Hitt (1999) as the source of this definition, but this is incorrect.
- Any deliberate firm action intended to influence _governmental_ policy or process. (Getz, 1997). 
  - Getz uses the term corporate political _action_. 

---

__Things to think about__:

- Definition of the firm.
  - Talcott Parson: _[an entity whose] defining characteristic is the attainment of a specific goal or purpose._ 
    - This definition appears too vague to me. There are plenty of organizations who attempt to attain a specific goal or purpose, but that are not considered to be businesses or firms, like churches, sporting clubs, and NGOs. 
  - Ronald Coase: _Nexus of contracts to minimze transactions costs of markets._
    - Also adopted by Jensen and Meckling (1976) and Sundaram and Inkpen (2004).
  - The corporation as a shareholder value maximizing economic entity. 
  - A _productive organization_ (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosphy): an organization whose purpose it is to create goods and services for sale, usually at a profit.
- Definition of government.
- The annoying literature on _corporate citizenship_.
  - The political role firms play to promote social welfare.
  - Protecting human rights in repressive countries.
  - Reducing disease and illiteracy.
  - Corporate citizenship is used to describe actions like that of Merck and their decision to freely distribute a drug to sub-Saharan Africans for the treatment of river blindness. Merck made no money but continues to enage in this practice. Authors also use _corporate sustainability_ and _corporate social responsibility_ to describe these actions. __It is doubtful that anything important hangs on one's choice of label.__
- Does digitization increase political participation by multinationals?
- What if the firm has a foreign owner that is a strategic adversary, or a genuine political enemy?
- Why are so few firms politically active?
  - Campaign donations as consumptions goods rather than a market for buying policy?
- Not since Hillman et al. (2004) have scholars attempted to synthesize the literature on CPA from different fields. 
- No focus on Super PACS?
- Has there been an evolution regarding the normative considerations of scholars on political activities by business entities? 
  - Epstein (1969) already argued quite strongly for the significance of business political activity, insofar as he stated that _every_ business is affected by public policy. 
  - Perhaps the strongest advocation for the signficance of corporate political activity came from Boddewyn & Brewer (1994), who stated that government should be considered as a _factor of production_. 
    - The Penguin Dictionary of Economics defines _factors of production_ as: "The inputs or resources used in the process of production. Land, labour, and capital are the three primary groups used in analysis of factors, with entrepreneurship often counted as fourth. 

---

__Things to write in article__:

- The key differentiator between management literature and other scholarly work that deals with corporate political activity, is _the selection of the firm as the basic unit of analysis_.
- This means that management scholars scrutinize the relationship between firms and governments _from the perspective of the firm and/or manager_.
- Corporate political activity, _as a phenomenon_, started gaining traction in the 1970s, following a large increase in social regulation in the United States.
- Accepted reasons/motivations for engaging in CPA:
  - legitimacy.
  - industry structure: size, market share, government dependence.
- Politics scientists/political economists consider the relationship between business and politics as a power struggle, with most concurring that firms have accumulated a considerable amount of power due to their size, global value chains, and technological superiority.
- Somewhere, we have witnessed a shift from the notion that businessmen are the most qualified and desirable individuals to elect as democratic representatives, towards the notion that businessmen are conniving, untrustworthy, and detestable creatures whose power needs to be checked every way possible. 

---

__The relationship between business and governance has been studied within the field of management under different nomenclatures and perspectives__:

- Nonmarket strategy (Baron, 1995).
  - Strategy formulation must integrate both market _and_ nonmarket components.
- Corporate political activity (Hillman).
- Corporate citizenship (Matten, Moon, & Crane).
  - Descriptively framing the empirical relationship between corporations and the individual. 
  - Corporations as administrators of a bundle of citizen rights: social, civil, and political, conventionally granted by governments.
  - This is really nothing new, see the work of Cutler (1995; 1999).
  - Nations have failed to be the sole guarantor of individual rights: social, civil and political. 
  - Corporations as channels (political), enablers (civil), and providers (social).
- Political CSR (Scherer & Palazzo, 2007; 2011).
  - Has distinct ideas concerning governance models, rule of law, responsibility, legitimacy, and democracy. 
  - Authors propose to understand the corporation _as a political actor_.
  - Authors want a new theory that emphasizes the public role of private business. 
  - Talk a lot about the post-national constellation.
  - How much is the state truly losing its regulatory capacity and enforcement power?
- Stakeholder theory (Freeman). 
  - The fundamental issue, according to Freeman (1984), is _how to manage in a world where there are multiple influences from various levels of government, or more properly from governments, and where the corporation and its managers can in turn affect the direction of public policy and government action_?
  - For this, we need to understand _what interactions are possible among business and government actors_.
  - Today's CEO must spend a good deal of time and resources worrying about proposed public policy legislation from Congress.

---

__An economic perspective on the firm__:

- Firms exist in many shapes and forms, and neoclassic economic theory aspires to assert common principles that apply to all of them.
- The internal characteristics of firms are based on _non-market_ principles: hierarchy and command.
- The firm is an atomistic unit in an economic environment characterized by equilibrium processes.
- Profit maximization is the universal goal of the firm.
- The following knowledge is considered __given__: the firm's production function, showing the relationship between used factors of production and the output of the finished product; the prices of the factor of production; the demand curve.
- The firm thus need only deduce the level of output such that marginal revenue equals marginal cost.
- The firm is a passive respondent to existing market conditions.
- Firms must combine the factors of production efficiently.
- Firms must produce the optimal level of output.
- The total number of firms in an industry, in the long run, is just right.
- Market price is kept at a minimum through _consumer sovereignty_.
- Two key points:
  - Although firms are presented as _engines of efficiency_ in neoclassical economics, in reality, firms often engage in behavior that is antithetical to social welfare, such as limiting new entrants, collusion, retarding technological innovation, etc. Exploring such conduct requires relaxing the theoretical assumption of the firm as an atomistic unit.
  - The theory is based on distinctive assumptions about _rationality_ and _the nature of the environment in which economic decisions are made_. Whether neoclassical economic theory successfully predicts or explains outcomes in the market depends on the degree to which these assumptions are consistent with the real world.

__A Political Economy Perspective on Transnational Production__:

- Establish the difference between foreign direct investment and portfolio investment.
  - FDI involves an investment in which the investor retains direct control over the resources invested.
    - Example FDI: investor opens a new production facility abroad.
  - Portfolio investment abandons such control.
    - Example portfolio: investor moves capital from one country to another.
- Rise of the transnational corporations (TNC).
  - A TNC is a firm that owns and controls production (value-added) activities in two or more countries.
- Many terms exist for this entity.
  - Transnational corporation.
  - Multinational corporation.
  - Global corporation.
- Explain the growth of TNCs.
  - Vernon: product life-cycle model.
  - Dunning: ILO-paradigm.
  - Strange: structuralist explanation.
    - Technology.
    - Finance.
    - Falling real cost of transportation.
  - Hymer: monopolistic advantage.
- Positives of FDI:
  - Direct:
    - FDI provides additional resources, capital, technology, access to markets, and management skills.
    - Additional tax revenues.
    - Increased GDP.
    - New economic linkages.
    - Improved balance of payments.
  - Indirect:
    - Inject entrepreneurship, new management practices, and cultures into society.
    - Increased levels of competition and thus innovation and growth.
    - Enhancing national welfare.
- Negatives of FDI:
  - Direct:
    - Too few or wrong resources transfered.
    - Minimalizing tax payments.
    - Wrong division of labor __?__
    - Deteriorate balance of payments.
  - Indirect:
    - Unacceptable degree of market concentration.
    - MNEs keep country at low level of production.
    - MNEs might introduce civil unrest.
    - Political interference.
- Major Developments:
  - Globalization of production.
    - Technological change.
    - Communications and transport.
    - Finance.
    - Political.
  - Changing organizational principles.
    - Fordist to post-Fordist.
    - Mergers, strategic alliances, and joint ventures.
    - Global supply chains.
- Key issues:
  - Benefits of FDI.
  - State-firm relations.
    - Changing attitudes.
    - Decision-making and national autonomy.
    - Transforming state policies.
    - Labour.
  - Regulating Capital.
- Conclusion:
  - Spread of TNCs has had significant influence on international economic structures.
  - Much of the development of economies can be partly explained by MNEs and government policies towards MNEs.
  - TNCs have a great deal of strategic power.

# Articles and Books on Corporate Political Activity

## Fainsod, 1940, Yale Law Review

### Regulation and Efficiency

- Discusses how regulation can foster _efficiency_ and _progressiveness_ in the management of regulated enterprises. 
  - Most regulation simply focused on how to determine optimal rates of profit, specifically profit limitation. 
  - This is mostly due to the courts, who have determined that businesses have a right to a _fair_ return on their property.
  - Regulation necessarily introduces the the very difficult problem of the precise line of demarcation between the authority of private management and the authority of the government agency.
  - Vesting the agencies with too much power was considered an encroachment on property rights and an invesion of the traditional domain of managerial freedom, and thus undesirable.
- Argues that an effective regulatory policy need to secure efficient, widespread and economical serivce for the consuming public. 
- This involves more than the regulation of profits. 
- __Controversial statement__: should public authority be asked to perform functions that management performs?
- Argues that regulatory agencies must receive more qualified staff and financial report in order to function in a more comprehensive capacity. 
- Wants agencies to reshape their conceptions of the regulatory task.
- Does not argue for public ownership of factors of production.
- Argues that the present system of regulation induces utility management to maximize profits through litigation rather than reducing cost by improving efficiency.
- Because efficient management would need to be rewarded by stockholders and that remains an open question. 
- Basically asks and answers the question what constitutes efficienct management.
- Refers to the seperation of ownership and control.
- __Core issue__: good management is not rewarded and poor management is not punished. 
- Interesting prediction where the management of public utilities would be achieved through a collaborate/deliberative process between competent regulatory agencies and utility managers.

## Wood, 1959, The Business Lawyer

### Corporate Political Activity

Very interestingly, this article is titled _Corporate Political Activity_. Also interesting is the tone of the article, which conveys the fact that corporate political activity is, in a legal sense, _uncharted territory_.
Author has two objectives. First, to delineate the scope of legality of corporate political activity. Second, set out the new government relations program introduced by the General Electric Company.

- Contributions to candidates are taboo.
- Communications within the firm are fair game.
- Outside communication in favor of a candidate is taboo. 
- Author predicts that companies will become more politically active and so the law will develop.
- Businessmen, in their capacity as managers, can conduct three types of political activities:
  - Improving the business climate in the local community.
  - Providing spokesmanship in legislative issues that might affect the business situation or the economy as a whole.
  - Providing leadership, inspiration, and the means so that all managers in the company can understand the art and practice of politics.
- General Electric's concern is not with particular candidates or parties, but with particular issues affecting the business community and the nation.
- Managers should not move beyond the criticisms of their objective to strengthen the system of free enterprise.

## Epstein, 1969, Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall

### The Corporation in American Politics

The setup of this book seems to confirm the notion of Baysinger and Keim (1988) that business political activity is a subset of interest group politics research.

- Few have devoted academic effort to understand the _motivations_, _methods_, and _overall significance_ of political involvement by corporations. 
  - Scholars have focused on traditional groups.
  - Companies hate to disclose their political activities.
  - Distinction between CPA and political actions of corporate executives as individuals unclear. We need, of course, consider the political actions of managers _in their capacity as manager_.
  - Scholars did not consider businesses as entities which possess noneconomic dimensions. This relates to the economic perspective of the firm.
- CPA is inevitable: even the most economically insignificant enterprise is vitally affected by governmental policy.
- _Business organization was used as a model for the reorganization of governmental bodies to increase efficiency._ Talk about the relationship between business and government, this is a highly signifcant insight. There was a time where business was used as a model for government. Perhaps this is worth expanding on.
- 1907 Tillman act: prohibits corporate contributions to the campaigns of parties and candidates in federal elections. This is also mentioned in Wood (1959).
  - Corporations did so anyway through other channels.
- Trade associations became prevalent in the period 1912-1946.
- _Paul H. Douglas made Baron's point in 1952._
- Corporate involvement in governmental and electoral activities have been a part of American political history since before its founding.
- Epstein already discusses:
  - The impact of automation on employment.
  - The possible invasion of privacy by unrestricted use of new electronic devices and information systems.
  - The influence of news media on the political and cultural life of the country.
- Expansion of government economic activities after 1946.
  - Employment act 1946.
  - Cold war.
  - Technological advancements.
  - Proliferation and intensification of social problems.
- _Political effectiveness is [so] essential to business effectivness ... that no prudent person, especially the businesssman, can afford to be above politics_.
- The vast majority of companies began their politics program after 1957.
- Why did many companies start to go at it (political action) alone?
  - Limited political interests and ample economic funds.
  - Companies may have interests in direct opposition to other firms in the industry.
  - Associations do not represent the views of large companies __?__.
  - Corporate managers are dissatisfied with the negative stance of trade associations.
  - Success of associations is highly debatable. 
- Corporations engage more in governmental activities than electoral activities:
  - Electoral activities are periodic, while governmental activities are continuous.
  - Corporations have historically been more effective at accomplishing governmental objectives than at achieving electoral success.
  - Legal restrictions on corporate electoral participation.
- Political involvement depends on: the size of the firm; the extent of public regulation; the importance of governmental decision to its operations.
  - Already mentioned in this book, yet still studied in recent empirical work.

## Stilger, 1971, The Bell Journal of Economics and Management Science

### The theory of economic regulation

- The traditional role of regulation in economic analysis is a _deus ex machina_ that eliminates an unfortunate market failure.
- This is delusional.
- The central tasks of a theory of economic regulation are the following:
  - To explain who will receive the benefits or burdens of regulations.
  - What form regulation will take.
  - The effects of regulation upon the allocation of resources.
- The state has awesome powers and every industry or occupation able to utilize the state's power in order to increase profitability will do so. 
- Four main policies:
  - Direct subsidies.
  - The enactment of entry barriers.
  - Affecting subsitute and complementary products.
  - Price fixing.
- Successful bidders in the political auctions are numerically compact groups due to the relationship between groups size to the cost of using the political process.
- Information costs offset prospective gains: a single voter with small per capita stakes will not incur them.

## Vogel, 1978, British Journal of Political Science

### Why Businessmen Distrust Their State: The Political Consciousness of American Corporate Executives

Article is mostly about corporate ideology towards the state.

- Why should the group in American society that has disproportionately benefited from governmental policies continue to remain distrustful of political intervention in the economy?
- For all businessmen, governmental involvements is inimical to a sound economy and incompatible with a free society.
- 1965-17 and 1902-12 are marked by absence of industrial strife and general economic prosperity, as well as popularity of CSR. 
  - Especially concerning the integration of underprivileged and previously disenfranchised minorities. 
- Executives do support government intervention if it is to their benefit.
- The real issue is thus: _how do executives decide whether governmental policies are in their interest_?
  - Vogel argues that this has something to do with whether the policy weakens or strengthens the autonomy of management.
  - Business opposition towards unions and extensions of the welfare state.
- Three main hypotheses:
  - The mistrust of the state by businessmen is a function of the state's previous role in industrial development: the greater the state's leadership and direction, the greater the cohesiveness between present business and governmental elites.
  - The ideological hostility towards states by businessmen is a function of their state's democratic heritage: the greater the responsiveness of the state to popular demands, the more likely it is businessmen will find increased state authority over economic decisions threatening?
  - The smaller the state's previous role in industrial development, the greater the fragmentation of authority within the business community.

## Gram & Crawford, 1979, Long Range Planning

### Corporate Strategies for Political Action

- The attempt to differentiate between types of strategic choices on the basis of market and non-market relationships limits, confuses, and distorts the strategic decision-making process, and the nature of the firm's relationship with its environment.
  - Objection to the market and nonmarket seperation?
- Interorganizational relationship model.
- Adaptation.
- Co-optation.
- Interpenetration.
- Preemption.
- Destruction or conflict.

### Political Influence: Strategies Employed by Organizations to Impact Legislation in Business and Economic Matters

The goal of this study was to determine the extent of usage of various influence strategies and to evaluate their relative impact on the legislative process.

- Authors examine strategies the business lobbyists, consumer groups, unions, and federal agencies employ to shape federal legislation. 
- The actors employ different strategies, which have varying impacts on the legislative process.
- Three types of actors in the _legislative influence process_:
  - Societal interest groups.
  - Nonlegislative government bodies.
  - Industry and business groups.
- How to assess a corporation's political power (Finer, 1955)?
  - Organization: ability to mobilize and leverage resources.
  - Riches: amount of disposable funds for lobbying.
  - Audience: organizational access to key influentials.
  - Dependence: ability of organization to make employeees committed to goals and strategies.
  - Surrogateship: ability of organization to create or alleviate economic problems in society.
- Added by Epstein (1969):
  - Corporate influence over media.
  - Historical political successes of business.
  - The public stature of business executives.
- But it remains difficult to operationalize the above-mentioned.
- Categories of influence techniques:
  - Information: expert witness; personal visits; technical reports.
  - Public exposure: media campaign.
  - Direct Pressure: threat of harm or financial support.
  - Political: constituent contact.
- Three hypotheses:
  - The three major influence sectors (business, society, and nonlegislative government) will employ different stategies to influence government.
  - Influence methods will not have significantly different impacts on the legislative process.
  - Positive modes of influence will not produce signficantly greater impacts on the legislative process than will negative modes.
- Information-based influence attempts were utilized more extensively than any other approach.
  - Will the amount of information overload the capacities of the legislative apparatus?
- The three major influence sectors tend to adopt unique strategy _sets_.
- Positive modes of influence tend to work better.
  - You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.

### How Multinationals can Manage Social and Political Forces

- Multinationals operate in an environment where the rules of the game are far more ambiguous, contradictory, and subject to rapid change compared to domestic firms __!__
- Looks at determinants of appropriate conflict behavior. 
- More focused on conflict management and using MNEs as background because of their complexity. 
- __Coping__ with conflict. 
- Two continui:
  - Assertiveness.
  - Cooperativeness.
- Depends on four situational variables:
  - Outcome stakes (assertiveness).
  - Relative power (assertiveness).
  - Interest interdependence (cooperativeness).
  - Relationship quality (cooperativeness).
- Five outcomes:
  - Competitive.
  - Collaborative.
  - Compromise.
  - Avoidant.
  - Accommodative.
- Talks about _stakes_.
- Conflict management demands accurate assessment of each side's stakes and power positions and the consequences for each side of various possible outcomes.

### Foundations of a Political Strategy for Business

- Echoes Epstein (1969): _In fact, there is no more false dichotomy that of business and society. (Keim, 1981, p. 48)_.
- Already discusses:
  - Lobbying.
  - CPACs.
  - Political coalitions.
  - Public affairs.
  - Building a corporate constituency.
- A successful political strategy will encourage policymakers to be more responsive to the interests of business and the large natural constituency of business.

### Domain Maintenance as an Objective of Business Political Activity: an Expanded Typology

- Business Political Activity.
- Some authors point to this article as the bedrock of the definition of CPA, but this is unclear from reading the article.
- Is this article perhaps tied to the _social license_ argument?
- The typology implies that these categories are discernable, yet this is unclear given the fact that their methods are largely similar: what is the added value of this typology?
- _Domain management_: gain monetary and anticompetitive favors from government.
  - Goal: gain at the expense of others (economic rent).
  - Methods: PACs, lobbying, trade associations, etc...
  - _Stigleresque_. 
- _Domain defense_: manage environmental turbulence created by governmental threats to the legitimacy of __organizational goals__ and purposes. 
  - Goal: challenge and rebuff threats to organizational goals and purposes, _including those posed by government._
  - Methods: PACs, lobbying, trade associations, etc...
- _Domain maintenance_: manage similar threats to the __methods__ by which organizations pursue their goals and purposes. 
  - Goal: challenge threats to the methods by which organizational goals and purposes are pursued, _especially those posed by the government_.
  - Methods: PACs, grass-roots efforts, lobbying, Washington office.
  - This is the novel strategic objective.

## Keim & Zeithaml, 1986, Academy of Management Review

### Corporate Political Strategy and Legislative Decision Making: A Review and Contigency Approach 

The dependent variable in the model of Keim & Zeithaml is _individual political action_, this is somewhat perplexing.

- The literature provides limited guidance regarding the situations in which they (corporate political strategies) should be implemented. 
- Primary purpose of this paper is to propose a conceptual foundation that management may employ to examine various corporate political strategies and to evaluate their effectiveness.
- Political strategy _effectiveness_ has received very little research attention.
  - Is this true?
  - And effectiveness in terms of what?
- Attempt to provide a theoretical basis for determining _effective_ corporate political strategies.
- The following strategies are considered:
  - constituency building: _corporate efforts to identify, educate, and motivate to political action those individuals who may be affected by public policies that have an impact on the corporation_.
  - Political action committees contributions: _corporate campaign contributions made through a political action committee (PAC)_.
  - Advocacy adveristing: _reaching a general audience with messages regarding public policy issues_. 
  - Lobbying: _efforts by political professionals or company executives to establish communication channels with regulatory bodies, legislators, and their staffs_. 
  - Coalition building: _efforts by the corporation to find other groups of voters who may share common political interests on a particular legislative issues_. 
- Limited to legislative decision making and corporate political efforts to influence these decisions.
- Traditional political strategies of lobbying and direct campaign contributions have been supplemented or replaced in many firms with alternative strategies. 

Authors build a model with the following assumptions:

  1. Legislators have reelection as their primary goal.
  2. Reelection is the prerequisite for a political career and, hence, the pursuit of other member goals.
  3. Constituents in a specific district are assumed to be interested in a single issue 
  4. The attitudes and voting behavior of constituents are known with perfect certainty.

$$A = EO + P- C $$

- $A$ = the probability of individual political action.
- $E$ = the probability that individual political action results in collective benefits.
- $O$ = the value of collective benefits to the individual.
- $EO$ = the expected value of collective benefits to the individual. 
- $P$ = the value of private benefits of individual political action.
- $C$ = the value of private costs of individual political action.

- Authors provide a typology: a classification scheme where the types are defined based on key situational or _contingency_ variables.
- The salience of an issues for voters in a legislator's district.
- The relative degree of consensus or conflict among voters regarding these issues. 
- Different corporate political strategies are more effective in some situations than in other situations.

### The Efficacy of Business Political Activity: Competitive Considerations in a Principal-Agent Context

Authors develop a conceptual basis for considering the efficacy of certain types of political activities using a _principal-agent model_.  
The article basically integrates some elements of principal-agent relationships in legislative decision-making in different scenarios with the resource-based view of effective product-market strategies.

- The efficacy of corporate attempts to affect political decision-making in legislatures or regulatory agencies remains elusive.
  - Business political actvitiy is a _subset_ of the study of interest group politics.
  - Two core stumbling-blocks: there is no universally accepted model of political decision-making to evaluate efforts to exert political influence; a lack of explicit consideration of the competitive nature of the influence process.
- Business political activity has grown in significance since 1960.
  - However, it is crucial to acknowledge that most interest groups active in US politics were formed after 1960.
- State politics are important to businesses today.
- There is disagreement within the field of political science as pertaining to the power of (big) business.
  - At times, firms appear to get what they want, at other times, they do not. An example of this is the case of big oil companies, which were successful in influencing US energy policy until the 1970s but unsuccessful thereafter.
- Key objective: specify the conditions under which business political activity can influence political decision-makers.
- Agency costs arise (in some form) in any situation involving cooperative effort by two or more people, _even though there might not be a clear-cut principal-agent relationship_.
- Agency problems in political representation: positive information costs and transaction costs associated with political choice.
- There is disagreement in the field of political science as to the degree of autonomy enjoyed by legislators.
  - In a pluralist model, the government responds to societal pressures as an arbitrator.
  - Some have argued that this is too simplistic and legislators are free because of the complexities of the procedure, the chances of obfuscation, and the limited attention paid by constituents to any particular issue.
- Key insight: the ability of interest groups in general to affect legislators depends on the degree to which voters are _informed on issues and the behavior of legislators_.  
  - Because if the voter is uninformed or uninterested, the resources supplied by interest groups reduce agency costs.
- Agencies function as agents of the legislators, who in term function as agents of the constituents.
- Legislative decisions can be categorized in three classes:
  - Constituents are interested and their interests are homogenous.
  - Constituents are interested and their interest are heterogenous.
  - Constituents are uninterested or uninformed.
- Similarities of product-market strategies and business political strategies.
  - A pattern in a stream of managerial decision-making that is designed to align the organization with its external environment (Porter, 1980; 1985).
  - It is an integrated set of actions among a number of value-creating activities.
  - Business political activity is similar, with the exception that the objective of CPA is to _produce_ favorabel policy outcomes.
- Strategies need to be formulated and appropriate. The former is relevant only insofar as the latter is present.
- Crucial aspects of CPA strategy:
  - Potential value.
  - Imitability
  - Organizational requirements.
- Successful political strategies combine the elements of potential value, imperfect imitability, and proper organization to gain sustained competitive advantage.
- A crucial question to ask is whether a firm is intent on _maintaining the status quo_ or _achieving change_.

### International-Business Political Behavior: New Theoretical Directions

- Authors offer a helpful history of CPA research:
  - Robinson (1964); Fayerweather (1969); Behrman (1971); Vernon (1971); Moran (1973).
- Authors position their work as a foil to Fayerweather by arguing that political behavior is an _intrinsic_ part of international-business behavior. 
  - Fayerweather considered political behavior as something 'occasional, necessary, and yielding unsubstantive contributions to subsidiaries.'
- Politics interferes everywhere with the allocation of scare economic resources. 
- Government as a factor of production __?__
- Develop integrated model of political behavior.
- Revise some key assumptions.
- Offer propositions about political behavior's conditions, forms, and intensities. 
- Derive various implications for strategic theorizing. 
- Political behavior is affected by:
  - The task-based nature of the firm.
  - Firm's industry.
  - Firm's nonmarket environment: _essentially, governments, interest groups, the intelligentsia, and public opinion_.
- Firms desire market power, efficiency, and legitimacy.
- Firms achieve the above-mentioned through political behavior. 
- Political behavior can take on two forms.
  - Bargaining (engage): conflict, partnership.
  - Non-bargaining (non-engage): compliance, avoidance, circumvention.
- Political behavior can have different intensity. 
- Logical connection: conditioned on factors in the firm, the industry of the firm, and the nonmarket environment, firms exhibit political behavior in two distinct forms, bargaining and non-bargaining, to achieve their strategic objectives, namely market power, legitimacy, and/or efficiency.
- Propositions:
  - The first proposition introduces the role of the conditioning factors of the firm, the industry, and the nonmarket environment.
  - Compliance when governmental actions have low salience or lack of resources to combat.
  - Avoidance when the benefits of avoidance exceed legitimacy costs.
  - Conflict when high salience, perception of zero-sum game, sufficient power.
  - Partnership when state willingness for market failure correction is high, perception of positive-sum game, and sufficient power.
  - Intensity will be high when stakes are high, opportunities plentiful, and sufficient or enhanceable political competences.
- Political behavior belongs necessarily to the study of international strategy management.

## Baron, 1995, California Management Review

### Integrated Strategy: Market and Nonmarket Components

- The environment of business is composed of market and nonmarket components, and any approach to strategy formulation must integrate both market _and_ nonmarket components.
- Market environment:
  - Interactions between the firms and other parties that are intermediated by markets or private agreements.
  - Economic transactions.
  - Exchange of property.
- Nonmarket environment:
  - Interactions between the firm and other parties that are intermediated by the public, stakeholders, government, the media, and public institutions. 
- Key difference/characteristics between market and nonmarket environment: 
  - Majority rule.
  - Due process.
  - Broad enfranchisement.
  - Collective action.
  - Publicness.
- Interactions in the nonmarket environment may be voluntary or involuntary. 
- Market strategy: a concerted pattern of actions taken in the market environment to create value by improving economic performance.
- Nonmarket strategy: a concerted pattern of actions taken in the nonmarket environment to create value by improving _overall_ performance.
- Nonmarket environment:
  - Social.
  - Political.
  - Legal.
  - Issues: addressed by nonmarket strategies.
  - Institutions.
  - Interests: individuals and groups with preferences about, or a stake in, an issue.
  - Information: what the interested parties know or believe about the relation between actions and consequences and about the preferences and capabilities of the interested parties.
- Generally, nonmarket strategies are more important the more opportunities are controlled by governments and are less important when opportunities are controlled by markets.
  - This ties together with the argument why businesses became more active politically following the 1960s.
- But also challenges by interest and activist groups are relevant.

### Buffer or Bridge? Environmental and Organizational Determinants of Public Affairs Activities in American Firms. 

- Public affairs units are a window out through which management perceives, monitors, and understands the world, and a window in through which society can influence corporate policy and practice.
  - Public affairs units are thus __boundary spanning__.
- This boundary spanning serves two functions.
  - Buffering: resisting or trying to control environmental change.
  - Bridging: promoting internal adaptation to changing external circumstances.
- The relationship between a firm and its environment depends on the firm's size, the importance of the resources it controls, and its visibility. 
- Effects of the following variables. 
  - Size: increase buffer and decrease bridge.
  - Uncertainty: increase buffer and increase bridge.
  - Resource importance: increase buffer and decrease bridge.
  - Visibility: increase buffer and increase bridge and positive correlation with size.
- Mentions enterprise strategy: the philosophy of a firm's TMT plays a huge role in determining corporate actions towards social and political stakeholders.

### Firm-level Responses to Government Regulation: Theoretical and Research Approaches.

- Calls it _business political activity_.
  - Perhaps this is the more apt nomenclature __?__ 
- Focus on the interests of corporations and trade associations in the legislative and regulatory processes. 
- CEOs consider governmental affairs as a vital part of the job - both as defense and as offense. 
  - This resonates with the work of Baysinger.
- The following sources of literature deal with this:
  - Economics (public choice): political process as a market-like exchange.
  - Political science: business power and business interest. 
  - Interest group pluralism.
  - Organization theory: resource dependency.
  - Strategic management: effects of government regulation on intraindustry competition. 
- _Scholars interested in BPA are fragmented by their disciplinairy loyalties_.
- Literature lacks theoretical and methodological cohesion.
- Convergence on a few basic themes:
  - The institutional structure of business-government relations.
  - The use of BPA as a means of controlling the external environment.
  - The development of organizational structures for advocating political positions. 
- Biggest difference between managerial literature versus other social sciences is the micro-level perspective that takes _the firm as the unit of analysis_. 
- Rapid growth of CPA in the US between 1970 and 1985, reflecting the business response to the growth of social regulation beginning in the 1960s. 
- A managerial perspective of CPA suggest the following motivations for CPA:
  - Enhancing legitimacy (social license): firms must balance their efficiency in markets as attained through competitive advantage with social legitimacy in order for the firm to be allowed to function as part of the broader social system. 
  - Firm and industry structure: larger firms and firms that depend on government for purchases or intensive regulation are more likely to engage in CPA.
  - Attaining competitive advantage: linkages between public chocies and competitive strategies.
- Suggestions for future research include:
  - Regulation and deregulation as sources of environmental turbulence.
  - Integration of strategic management, political activity, and issues monitoring.
  - Conceptually develop the argument that influencing public policy is a source of competitive advantage.
  - Answering the question whether political power is a complement or an alternative to market power.
  - Is seeking competitive advantage through government less legitimate than competing in markets?
- "_Strategic management scholars have better things to do than dignify corporate political activity: as a social phenomenon it is interesting; but that is why we have sociologists._".

### Corporate Political Strategy Formulation: A Model of Approach, Participation, and Strategy Decisions 

Main contribution of article is to integrate the different types of CPA strategy into a taxonomy. Article explores the decisions firms make and the institutional and firm-level factors that lead to these decisions.

- Argues that, up to 1999, researchers have focused on three things: why government policy is important to firm's profitability; what the objectives are of firm political activity; and what types of firms are likely to become politically active. 
- Government policy affects firm performance.
  - Governments are sources of uncertainty for firms due to the vast amount of issues formulated in the public policy process. This may increase transaction costs.
  - Governments have control over critical resources.
  - There is a substantial interdependence between a firm's economic or business environment and government policy.
  - Governments (co-)determine the following:
    - The size of markets.
    - The structure of markets.
    - Alter the cost structure of firms.
    - Affect demand for product.
- Second managerial revolution (Weidenbaum, 1980). Due to the increase of government regulation, the relationship between the firm and government has been fundamentally altered.
- The success of business in the political arena is, for some businesses, as important as its success in the political arena (Baron, 1995).
- Important difference: do firms _participate_ in the public policy process or do they _compete_ with other interest groups?
- Core question: __How do firms engage in political behavior?__
- Added value: developing a comprehensive taxonomy of specific political strategies. 
- Corporate political behavior is an attempt to leverage the power of government to advance private ends (Mitnick 1993).
  - Resonates strongly with the work of Stigler. 
- Three decisions.
  - Transactional or relational.
    - (perceived) Dependence on government policy.
    - Product diversification. 
    - Degree of corporatism/pluralism.
  - Individual or collective.
    - Financial resources and other (intangible resources).
    - Degree of corporatism/pluralism.
    - Election issues & decision one.
  - Choice of strategy.
    - Informational.
    - Coalition-building.
    - Financial.

| Strategy | Tactics | Characteristics |
|---|---|---| 
| Information | Lobbying | Targets political decision-makers by providing information. |   
| Financial | Contributions to politicians or party | Targets political decision makers by providing financial incentives. |
| Coalition building | Grassroots mobilization| Targets political decision-makers indirectly through constituent support. |

### Pursuing Strategic Advantage through Political Means: A Multivariate Approach.

- Government policy as a source of competitive advantage.
- Governments determine:
  - The rules of commerce.
  - The structure of markets.
  - The offerings of goods and services that are permissible.
  - The sizes of markets based on government subsidies and purchases.
- But how accurate is it to say that governments _determine_ this as such?
- Specifically about how to pursue _access_.
- Embraces an analysis of _multiple political tactics_. 
- Because most studies have focused on a single tactic.
- Address a gap in the literature by conceptualizing why firms may want to _combine political tactics_.
  - Making political contributions.
  - Using staff lobbyists.
  - Hiring outside lobbyists.
- Introduces a relatively new estimation technique: alternating logistical regression.
- A firm can have a competitive advantage over its rivals in providing information that helps legislators be elected and reelected. If a firm can develop a strategy for delivering reliable political information to legislators, it is likely to gain and maintain political access.
- Seven hypotheses based on.
  - Collective action theory.
  - Institutional theory.
  - Resource dependency theory.
  - Competitive niche theory.
- Because a firm's political constraints may originate either within the firms or outside it. 
- DV in this research is the likelihood that firms _combine_ political tactics. 
- The authors challenge the existing political strategy classifications that put PACs and lobbying into seperate categories.
- The authors provide evidence that political activities need to be examined not separately, but together, as in the present study, because they are complementary. 
- Firms are likely to imitate the political activites of their rivals. 
- Shortcoming:
  - Simplistic model (direct effects).
  - Not all the data.
  - Soft money.
  - Supplying position papers.
  - Constituency building.
- The problem of firms without _visible_ political activites poses a substantial challenge to the reliability of coefficient estimates at to the robustness of the overall model.

### Corporate Political Activity: A Review and Research Agenda

Entire article is structured around the antecedents, types, outcomes, and organizing to implement CPA. 
It is unclear how they selected their articles: 'Our effort focuses primarily on research published in major scholarly journals since the time of Shaffer's (1995) _Journal of Management_ article, including both US and international inquiries.' They claim to synthesize literature from strategic management, sociology, political science, economics, and finance. 

- Provide a model of the antecedents, types, organizational implementations, and outcomes of CPA.
- Business firms spend considerable money and are among the most prominent political players not only in Washington D.C. but capitals all across the globe.

    - Firm dependency on government: resource dependency, firms have strong motivation to manage that dependency.
    - Firm slack: firms with more political slack are more likely to engage in CPA.
    - Firm diversification level: firms with more product diversification are more likely to engage in a relational CPA strategy.
    - Foreign ownership: has not been explored much. What if countries are strategic rivals?
  - Firm age.
  - Formalized firm structures.
  - Managerial influence.
- Industry.
  - Concentration.

### Nonmarket Strategy Performance: Evidence from US electric utilities

- Authors note that extant research has been relatively silent on the ability of firms to effect favorable public policy decisions. 
- Authors further argue that both the external environment, which they conceptualize as a political market involving demanders and suppliers of public policies, and the internal characteristics of firms both matter significantly to nonmarket performance.
- Nonmarket strategies are the coordinated actions firms undertake in public policy arenas. 
- Authors model the demand and supply of public policy. 
  - Demanders, such as firms, supply (non-market strategy) votes, finances, and information to suppliers, which are elected politicians, regulatory agencies, and courts.

## Oliver & Holzinger (2008) Academy of Management Review

###

- Authors attempt to to examine the strategies firms undertake to create or maintain value in political environment and the dynamic capabilities that contribute to their effectiveness. 
- The organizational literature and strategic management literature have paid limited attention to strategic political management as a source of value creation.
- Two key questions: 
  - What are the alternative strategies that are likely to be effective in influencing public strategies?
  - Under what conditions will these strategies be most effective in leading to higher performance and competitive advantage?
- __Core theoretical premise__: successful firms tend to view their political environments as opportunity sets within which they face choices about what objectives to pursue and how to pursue them in a way that best serves the firm. 
- The main point here is that political strategy is an opportunity, not a constraint. 
- Respond to Hillman et al. (2004) by saying that dynamic capabilities are suitable for addressing the internal processes enabling firms to execute political strategies. 
- Authors argue that none of the various perspectives on how and why firms manage their political environment consider it from the perspective of value creation or internal capabilities. 
- Value seeking may be a determinant of firms' decisions to engage in political strategies.
- Firms engage in political strategies to create or maintain their value.
- These firms are more likely to do so when they possess particular firm characteristics.
  - Larger firms.
  - Firms dependent on the political environment.
  - Firms that have a material interest in the public policy in question.
  - Firms that view a particular political issue as highly salient.
- Moreover, these firms are more likely to do so when they are in industries that are:
  - Highly concentrated
  - Impose significant political pressures on them.
- Refers to strategic political management: _the set of strategic actions that firms plan and enact for the purpose of maximizing economic returns from the political environment._
- Presents a dynamic capabilities framework to explain the effective strategic management of the political environment.
- Propose four firm-level strategies.
  - Proactive: value creation + influence.
  - Defensive: value maintenance + influence.
  - Anticipatory: value creation + compliance.
  - Reactive: value maintenance + compliance.
- Two ways firms can take advantage of political opportunities:
  - Actively influence (buffering).
  - Actively comply (bridging).
- Four theoretical perspectives have addressed strategic political management:
- __Public interest theorists__
  - Public policy is the outcome of interest group competition and business tends to undermine public interests and democratic processes.
  - Business is a monolithic interest group, uniformly affecting, and affect by, its political environment.
- __Economic theories__
  - Political activity is acquired or captured by industry and used for its benefit through direct subsidies and control over entry, prices, and the rules that determine substitutes.
  - Corporations and policy makers exchange inducements (votes and financial contributions) for favorable policy in order to maximize respective self-interests. 
  - Explains the influence of firms on policy makers and the challenges firms face in acting collectively and in exchanging inducements for favors in a political context.
- __Stakeholder management__ and __Resource Dependence Theory__
  - emphasizes the importance of social and political issues to a given company as key factors that motivate political strategy.
  - focuses on predicting the conditions under which firms will be motivated to engage in political influence, rather than on the conditions under which different political strategies will be effective in improving firm performance. 
- Reasons for and conditions under which firms will choose to engage in corporate political activity:
  - Making their interests known.
  - Gain collective or private benefits.
  - Access resources from political institutions.
  - Purchase government policy or secure government inaction.
  - Reduce costs.
  - Stop unwanted regulation.
  - Increase firm control and autonomy.
- In contrast, we still know very little about:
  - The capabilities that relate to the strategic management of firm's political environments
  - Firm-level outcomes of strategic political behavior. 
- __Propositions__:
- _Proposition 1_:
- The effectiveness of reactive political strategies depends on a firm's structural and process reconfiguration capabilities.
- The speed, efficiency, and innovativeness of architectural recongfiguration capabilities will determine the extent of their effectiveness
- Effective reactie political strategies result in higher efficiency and legitimacy for the firm
- _Proposition 2_:
- The effectiveness of anticipatory political strategies will depend on a firm's scanning and predictive capabilities.
- The frequency, breadth, innovativeness, and timeliness of scanning capabilities will determine the extent of their effectiveness.
- Effective anticipatory political strategies will result in first mover advantages and enhanced reputation for the firm.
- _Proposition 3_:
- The effectiveness of defensive political strategies will depend on a firm's capabilities to appropriate and use political social capital.
- The breadth and depth of trust and relational bonds in social contacts with government and with constituents who can influence government will determine the extent to which the deployment of political social capital is effective.
- Effective defensive political strategies will result in the protection of the current assets and market position of the firm.
- _Proposition 4_:
- The effectiveness of proactive political strategies will depend on the scope of a firm's institutional influence capabilities.
- The breadth and depth of a firm's embededdness in its economic and political environment will determine the effectiveness of the firm's institutional influence capabilities.
- Effective proactive political strategies will result in a closer perceived fit between a firm's actions and public policy requirements than the actions of the firm's rivals.

### Mixing Business with Politics: A Meta-Analysis of the Antecedents and Outcomes of Corporate Political Activity

- Takes Hillman et al. (2004) definition of CPA but adjusts it slightly.
- Mentions _Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission_ and states it opens ups the door to even higher levels of CPA.
- Understanding the relationship between business and politics remains an enigma.
- Mentions the fragmentation, just as Shaffer (1995).
- CPA is a component of firm nonmarket strategy.
- CPA is largely comprised of PAC contributions and lobbying. 
- Unlike in economic markets, high demand typically leads to low supply in political markets: politicians are less likely to supply policy when competing demands exist. 
- States that Epstein (1969) was the first scholarly effort focused on business and politics.
  - This is, of course, questionable.
- The biggest drivers of CPA are _political incumbency_, _government regulation_, and _firm size_.
- The magnitude of the relationships is very similar.
- The effects found were, however, __relatively small__.
  - The results may be viewed as troubling to scholars engaged in explaining why firms engage in CPA.
- Main drawback of meta analysis is the inability to examine either the compound or interactive effects of the specified antecedents.
- Article empirically examines two sets of core CPA scholarship questions.
  - What factors influence firms to engage in CPA and to what extent?
  - Does CPA affect firms performance and if so to what extent?
- Article offers 12 propositions.
  - Institutional Level Antecedents of CPA
    - _Political incumbency is positively related to CPA_.
    - _The number of politicians ideologically sympathetic to business interest is positively related to CPA_.
    - _The level of political competition is positively related to CPA_.
    - _The level of government regulation is positively related to CPA_.
    - _The level of firm government sales is positively related to CPA_.
    - _The level of politician dependence on firms is positively related to CPA_. 
  - Market and Industry level Antecedents of CPA
    - _The level of industry concentration is positively related to CPA_. 
    - _The level of foreign competition is positively related to CPA_.
    - _The level of economic activity is negatively related to CPA_ __?__
  - Firm level Antecedents of CPA
    - _Firms size is positively related to CPA_.
    - _Firm diversification is positively related to CPA_.
  - CPA and Firm Performance
    - _CPA is positively related to firm peformance_.
- All six proposed institutional antecedents were positively and significantly related to CPA.
- Less support was found for industry and market antecedents of CPA.
- Proposition 8 found results in the opposite direction __?__
- Both propositions at firm level were supported.
- The performance proposition was also supported.
  - This means that firms can obtain economic advantages through influencing government.
  - This, however, seems self-evident. 
  - It is less clear _how_ CPA affects firm performance. 
- Author argue that scholars typically do not account for context in CPA studies and instead examine broad samples or large Fortune 100 and 500 firms.
  - This is problematic.
- Should theories based on economic exchange be used for explaining politics?

__Critique of Hadani et al. (2017) on this article__.

- The authors do not explain the underlying linkage(s) between CPA and firm performance.
- The relationship between CPA and firm performance is likely sensitive to how we define firm performance. 
  - The authors focused solely on accounting-based performance measures.

### In Search of El Dorado: The Elusive Financial Returns on Corporate Political Investments

- Do corporations truly achieve their financial objectives when they engage in CPA?
  - CPA only leads to superior performance in _regulated_ industries.
  - CPA may not markedly improve firm financial performance.
  - CPA may actually harm some aspects of financial performance.
- The results suggest that personal managerial imperatives and biases, not firm-level profit-maximizing goals, drive corporate political behavior.
- Hiring former politicians to the board may not be an effective way to bolster performance.
- Empirical analysis has not convincingly supported the view that CPA leads to superior financial performance.
- Authors assert that the dominant view in the strategy literature is that CPA is a useful tool to improve a firm's financial performance.
  - Bonardi et al. (2005).
  - Hillman et al. (2004).
  - Oliver & Holzinger (2008).
  - Baron (1995).
- CPA affects financial performance both directly and indirectly. 
- Explore theoretical explanations why CPA might lead to superior or inferior financial performance.
  - Positive:
    - Industrial-organization economics.
    - Resource dependence theory.
  - Neutral:
    - The political marketplace theory.
    - The behavioral theory of the firm.
  - Hypotheses:
  - 1a,b: Corporate political investments in lobbying and campaigns will (not) be positively associated with corporate financial performance.
    - Cumulative corporate political investments in lobbying and campaigns will be positively associated with corporate financial performance.
    - Having former public officials serve on a firm’s board of directors will be positively associated with corporate financial performance.
    - Industry regulation will strengthen the positive relationships between corporate political investments and cumulative corporate political investments and corporate financial performance.
- The authors did not expect negative results.
- Give four reasons:
  - Senior managers who support CPA may in general take overly risky business decisions.
  - CPA may represent poor quality investments.
  - CPA is difficult for shareholders to monitor compared with many other firm strategies.
  - Personal reasons of senior managers, such as self-aggrandizement, ideological beliefs, desire to voice, and mimetic pressures may drive CPA.

### Corporate Political Activity: A Literature Review and Research Agenda

__Challenge the following: large players have enough resources to undertake individual lobbying, smaller actors often have to rely on collective action to be able to undertake political activities at different levels__. In the GDPR, we see major players hiding behind these _trade associations_ with vague names to create an aura of legitimacy. 

CPA research remains to this day U.S. centered. 

- Article mention Fainsod (1940).
- CPA focuses on the creation and maintenance of a specific set of external stakeholder relationships and policy outcomes, specifically with political and regulatory publics.
- Organizations engage in CPA primarily to create or maintain corporate profits.
- Three resulting benefits:
  - Reduced environmental uncertainty.
  - Reduced transaction costs.
  - Increased long-term sustainability.
- __Three predominant perspectives (domains) in CPA__:
  - __Resources and Capabilities__: the resource-based view.
    - Builds on the work of Fainsod (1940): an industry obtains favorable regulation by its capacity to mobilize three types of resources: financial (campaign financing),human (lobbyists), political (coalition building).
    - CPA studies have focused on how firms use their strategic political resources and capabilities to improve their profitability.
  - _Political capabilities_: technical-economic expertise in lobbying government.
    - Main weakness of this work is that the studies fail to discuss the collective nature of these political resources: how they might be combined in various ways by a firm in pursuit of competitive advantage. __Exception__: Schuler et al. (2002).
    - Political resources can be exercised in two distinct non-market policy contexts: endogenous and exogenous (predictable and unpredictable).
    - Endogenous: firm expects to be confronted by policy decision, stakeholders, issues or actions within a non-market political system.
    - Exogenous: a shock that coerces firms to adapt its political resources or risk losing competitive advantage.
- __Institutions__: institutional theory.
  - Illuminate the degree to which firms are embedded in local cultures, laws and history.
  - _Why is there such a startling homogeneity in organizational forms and practices? (DiMaggio & Powell 1983)_  
  - Two main contributions to CPA:
  - How different political, social and economic arrangements affect firm-government relations.
  - How firms adapt (or not) to alterations and evolution in the non-market environment. 
  - For many emerging economies, CPA essentially involves corruption, or at least the extensive use of connections.
  - Vogel (1996) asserts that until the 1970s firms barely engaged in CPA. __Challenge__: Epstein argues that CPA has been the norm in the US since before its founding.
  - Environmental and development movements.
  - Government regulation.   
- __Political Environment__: atheoretical examination of national political structures, cultures, and political risks. (subset of institutional perspective?)
  - Stigler (1971)
  - Mitchell et al. (1997)
  - Snyder (1990)
- __Effect of CPA on performance__: 
- Directions for future research include:
  - resources and capabilities
  - institutional constructs
  - political environment

- Authors find that CPA is positively related to firms performance, although there are some nuances between emerging and developed markets, as well as some counter evidence. 
- __Institutional context__ influences the political strategies used by firms, the performance outcomes of those strategies, and the mechanisms through which those strategies affect performance outcomes. 
- Sample of 56 articles.
  - 37 journals.
  - 6 within the field of management.
  - finance and economics journals dominate.
  - Range 1988-2015.
- Implied motivations for CPA:
  - globalization
  - competition
  - regulation
- Uses Hillman & Hitt (1999) framework.
- Relational strategies are the most researched.
- Informational strategies are the least researched.
- Outcomes.
  - Positive.
  - Negative.
  - None.
- Mechanisms.
  - Social capital.
  - Cronyism & corruption.
- A larger proportion of studies in developed nations reported negative or insignificant results.
- Definition of _political connection_ is a bit loose in developing markets.
- CPA targeted at influencing policy outcomes is mostly successful.
  - roll call votes
  - subsidies
  - entry barriers/protection from competition
- CPA seems more effective in developing nations.
  - especially relational strategies, which yield superior stock performance.
- Does not result in policy change because developing nations have net yet developed political institutions that take into account the positions or interests of the private sector.
- MNEs should develop their political capabilites for risk reduction and superior competitive advantage.
- __Social capital is just about the most valuable political asset a firm can have in emerging countries__.
- Paucity of research on the usage of the information strategy in emerging economies.
- Central in the literature is the claim that __context influences the strategies used by firms__ and the type of outcomes CPA can achieve.
- The outcomes of CPA are the least studied.

### A Review of the Nonmarket Strategy Literature: Toward a Multi-Theoretical Integration

- Accepts definition of Hillman et al. 2004.
  - Also cites it correctly.
- Integrates and synthesizes strategic CSR and CPA literature.
- Focuses on the performance consequences of nonmarket strategies.
- Effective nonmarket strategy is of vital importance to firm survival, organizational performance, and possibly sustainable competitive advantage.
- Only selected articles that specifically addressed organizational peformance.
- Only selected articles where the application of at least one general theory was explicitly acknowledged. 
  - What are the drawbacks of this?
- Argues that CPA together with strategic CSR constitute the nonmarket strategy literature. 
  - That is up for debate.
- Scholars are no longer satisfied with identifying a direct link between nonmarket strategies and performance.
  - Many studies explore the underlying mechanisms.
- Studies point to a variety of links between nonmarket strategies and organizational outcomes. 
  - Consumer perceptions.
  - Access to finance.
  - Preferential access to political resources.
  - Improved relationship with primary stakeholders.
- Scholars are increasingly using multiple theories.
  - Agency theory.
  - Institutional theory.
  - Resource-based view.
  - Resource dependence.
  - Stakeholder theory (dominant paradigm).
  - Public choice theory.
  - Signaling theory.
  - Social embeddedness.
  - Social identity theory.
  - Transaction cost economics.
- Nonmarket stakeholders:
  - Government actors.
  - Institutions.
  - Nongovernmental organizations.
  - Social and environmental activists.
  - Local communities.

| | Institutional Theory | RDT | RBV | Agency Theory | Stakeholder Theory |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| core assumption | legitimacy | interdependencies suppliers | resources and capabilities | agent incentives | managing relationships with stakeholders |
| performance prediction | positive | positive | positive | negative | negative |
|explanation of driver|   external | external | internal | internal | external |

- Article reinforces the view that empirical evidence on the direct link between nonmarket strategy and organizational performance is inconsistent despite a majority of the studies in their sample reporting a positive association. 
- __Firmly believe there is enormous value in continuing to borrow conceptual insights and methodologies from such related disciplines as sociology, political science, psychology, and history__. 
  - This is definitively something to cite in the article.

### Corporate political activity, public policy uncertainty, and firm outcomes: A meta-analysis

- Why is CPA not always beneficial to firms?
  - The uncertainty about the public policy process itself.
  - The uncertainty about the policies' impact on the firm. 
- Uses the definition of Hillman et al. (2004).
- Explores the context under which CPA is able to impact public policy outcomes and firm outcomes and when it is not. 
- Influence uncertainty
- The often fragmented and multi-actor nature of the public policy arena which makes public policy outcomes difficult to predict, and in particular, how much actors can affect policy decisions.
- Policy impact uncertainty
  - The difficulty for firms to evaluate what they should use CPA for.
- Trade association political activity, impact and nature, is little-known (cf. Rajwani et al. (2015)).

### Beyond Nonmarket Strategy: Market Actions as Corporate Political Activity.

- The authors argue that firms may attempt to change the effects of policies through market actions.
- The authors expand the focus of CPA research to include market actions in an attempt to better understand how firms attempt to shape their legal and regulatory environments.
- Two pathways by which firms' market actions may produce interpetive policy change:
  - Implementation: when firm's interpretations of incomplete laws alter and clarify the meaning of those laws.
  - Innovation: when firms enage in novel activities that are difficult to interpret within existing regulatory frameworks and thus alter the effects of those regulations.
- Claims that the existing work on CPA shares a common focus on how firm actions in the nonmarket environment influence policy.
- The authors posit there are unrecognized connections between legal scholarship and corporate political activity. 
  - The same probably goes for all disciplines in the social sciences.
- Literature is focused on formal changes to codified rules.
- Market actions may be useful for securing both formal and intepretive policy changes.
  - Jobs.
  - Mergers.
- Incomplete rules:
  - Type I: broad and general: ambiguous language. 
  - Type II: narrow and specific.
- Most laws exhibit some degree of incompleteness. 
- Legal endogeneity: a process through which the content and meaning of law is determined _within_ the social field that it is designed to regulate.
- Regulatory dialectic: perpetual dynamic where moves by one actor (regulator or regulated) condition the possibilities for moves by the other (regulator or regulated).
  - Game theory?
- Important point about viewing CPA as a process.
- Interesting point how because their work is built on earlier research and observations in the US, it is unclear to what extent it applies to other national settings.

### Nonmarket Strategy Research Through the Lens of New Institutional Economics: An Integrative Review and Future Directions

- Authors argue that, faced with weak institutions, firms can create and appropriate value by either adapting to, augmenting, or transforming the existing institutional environment, and can do so either independently or in collaboration with others.
- Authors develop a novel, integrative theoretical framework that synthesizes ostensibly disparate streams of nonmarket strategy research.
- __The study of nonmarket strategy may be conceived as the study of the alternative strategies firms employ to create and appropriate value in the face of institutional costs__.
- Six distinct types of nonmarket activities based on strategic intent and governance:
  - Internalization.
  - Partnership.
  - Proactive.
  - Collective.
  - Influence.
  - Coalition.
- Nonmarket strategy reflects alternative ways of dealing with weak institutions.
- Transactions costs result from:
  - Attributes of the transaction itself.
  - Attributes of the institutional environment in which the transaction is made (institutional costs).

### Self-categorization as a nonmarket strategy for MNE subsidiaries: Tracking the international expansion of an online platform.

- MNE subsidiaries engage in defensive and proactive self-categorization to create their nonmarket strategic fit.
- Subsidiaries do this through the use of labels, rhetoric, and narratives.
- We know little about how subsidiaries achieve a nonmarket strategic fit in the early stages of their expansion.
- How do subsidiaries develop nonmarket strategies to create a fit between a global market strategy and a local nonmarket framework?
- Authors expanded our understanding of self-categorization as a nonmarket strategy.
- Focus on _institutions_.
  - Formal: laws and regulations created at the various levels of government.
  - Informal: customs, traditions, norms, values, culture, and accepted behaviors. 
- Archival data and confirmatory interviews (N=11).

### The liabilities of foreign institutional ownership: Managing political dependence through corporate political spending.

- High levels of foreign institutional ownership leads to increased government scrutiny.
  - We know little about how firms cope with such scrutiny.
- The authors investigate how FIO shapes the nonmarket strategy that US firms deploy to manage such liabilities.
- FIO can increase US firms' political dependence both directly and indirectly.
- Thus firms engage in lobbying and contributions to political action committees.
- Lobbying: _transfer of information in private meetings and venues_.
- PAC contributions: grants access to monitor political developments.
- The positive relationship between FIO and CPS will be stronger when firms have more intensive government contracting or belong to national-security shaped industries.
- Three main contributions:
  - FIO increases firms' political dependence and lead these firms to invest in corporate political spending (CPS) to manage such dependence.
  - New antecedent of CPS: foreign institutional investors. 
  - Shedding light on an increasingly prominent class of global economic actors: foreign portfolio investors.
- __Government regulation shapes almost every aspect of business__.
- Hypothesis: A U.S. firm's level of FIO is positively associated with its level of CPS.
- The positive relationship between FIO and CPS is stronger in U.S. firms with high government-contract intensity than in those with low government-contract intensity.
- The positive relationship between FIO and CPS is stronger for U.S. firms operating in national-security-related industries than those operating in non-national-security related industries.

### Entrepreneurs' socioeconomic status and government expropriation in an emerging economy

- Institutions are important for entrepreneurs because they provide incentives and critical resources throughout the entrepreneurial process.
- But they are absent/corrupted in emerging economies.
  - Corruption.
  - Insecure property rights.
  - Weak enforceability of contracts.
- __Government expropriation__: rent extraction by the government from business sectors without a legal basis to increase revenues or provide public goods.
- Start-ups tend to experience the most severe threat of government expropriation.
- The authors posit that an entrepreneur's __socioeconomic status (SES)__ has an important bearing on government expropriation. 
- Information asymmetry means it is costly for government to obtain information about which start-ups to expropriate.
- They use the SES as a heuristic.
- This is particularly the case in regions with greater income inequality.
- Three contributions:
  - Focus on government expropriation.
  - Exploring the disadvantages of SES. 
  - Extending the inequality literature by considering _economic inequality_ and _political inequality_.
